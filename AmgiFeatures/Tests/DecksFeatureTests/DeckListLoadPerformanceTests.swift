/// Regression guard for the deck-list load — the action `AppSignpost` marks
/// as `DeckListLoad`, and the most expensive thing on the launch path.
///
/// Measured on a real 1,258-card / 38-deck / 14,777-revlog collection
/// (iPhone 17 Pro simulator, Release): `DeckListLoad` 192 ms, of which
/// `DeckListActivity` — the 365-day revlog assembly — was 45 ms and phase
/// one was 145 ms. A trace proves that today; this keeps it proven.
///
/// XCTest, not Swift Testing, deliberately: `measure(metrics:)` and the
/// `XCTClockMetric` / `XCTMemoryMetric` types have no Swift Testing
/// equivalent. The rest of the package's suites stay on Swift Testing.
///
/// These measure *assembly*, not the engine: the clients are stubbed, so a
/// regression here means the Swift-side mapping, state construction, or
/// heatmap folding got slower — not that the Rust backend did. Record a
/// baseline in Xcode (the diamond next to the test) for the numbers to be
/// enforced rather than merely reported.
